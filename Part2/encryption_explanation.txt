Encrypting the Database 

Settings.py added

INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
    'django_crypto_fields.apps.AppConfig',

Installed the following to 
models.py header

from django_crypto_fields.fields import EncryptedTextField

Added the following EncryptedTextField()  where data = models.BinaryField(unique=True)  was located

This will encrypt anything trying to access the database

  Key Management
  
  I used a .env file to store the keys. I used the following website to follow how to configure the .env file.
  https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/2015/11/26/package-of-the-week-python-decouple.html
  
  As the website shows we can use python-decouple. I create a .env file with the configuration information on the above website. I adjusted the data to fit the project information. After i created the file and saved it to the main project. I had to then add the import information in settings.py:
  
  Added from decouple import config
underneath import os in the settings.py file
by adding this it will use the configuration function to call the keys in the .env file.
