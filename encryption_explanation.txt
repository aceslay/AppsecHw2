Encrypting the Database 

Installed the following to 
models.py

from django_cryptography.fields import encrypt


class MyModel(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    sensitive_data = encrypt(models.CharField(max_length=50))
    
    This will encrypt anything trying to access the database
